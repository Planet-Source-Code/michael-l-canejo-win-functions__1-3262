## WIN Functions


</div>

### Description

This is basically for all you prankers out there that want to scare your friends or play jokes on them..In this project I made a Module with Functions that will do many things to your Windows, but never harm it in anyway. <br>Like: Hide/Show or Destroy the Windows ToolBar, Taskbar, Clock, Start Button, Icons in the Systray and more. It also lets you Reboot the Users computer, Restart it, Log Off the windows, and Force programs to close if they don't respond. I also made a Function that will make your Form black and cover the whole screen. Well that may seem simple but If the program is hidden from the Close Dialog box and the Control Alt Delete buttons are Disabled and the TaskBar and Toolbar is Hidden plus if the Form is OnTop of everytihng.. It will definatly scare or drive your friends crazy trying to close the program. On top of that, try to even figure out what happened? You could even put a message on the form saying "Virus Uploaded" or some lame junk like that :) To demonstrate these Functions I put together a "Enter Password" form that will do one or more or all of the Above if the user enters the password wrong 3 times.
